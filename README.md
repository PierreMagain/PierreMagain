After five years of study, I realized that theoretical studies did not meet my expectations. I redirected my focus towards computer science, a field in which I have always excelled and that has constantly attracted me. What motivates me is understanding and learning the concepts that govern information technology. This passion has allowed me to develop strong skills in programming, system administration, and DevOps tools. My goal is to find a job that allows me to continue evolving and learning from experienced individuals, so I can contribute significantly in the field of information technology.. Also, I am recently pursing a training in DevOps at [Technifutur](https://technifutur.be/formations/?id=INFO-FDE-032&dom=Num%C3%A9rique&public=).
